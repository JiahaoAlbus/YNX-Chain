## Release state

| State | Value | Direct basis |
|---|---:|---|
| implementedLocal | true | Runtime, API, Go and TypeScript SDKs, CLI, Ledger, Saga, migrations, backup and release tooling are present |
| testedLocal | true | Targeted tests, Data Fabric Race and full Go test with standard umask passed |
| installedLocal | true | Current-source local package, install and host cold-start gates pass |
| integratedCentral | false | No complete owner-acceptance receipt set exists |
| deployedStaging | false | No staging deployment receipt exists |
| deployedPublic | false | No public runtime or health receipt exists |
| downloadHosted | false | No immutable public artifact receipt exists |
| productionSigned | false | Only test-fixture signing is exercised |
| storeReleased | false | Native app-store delivery is not applicable to this headless service |

Remote CI is pending for the current Source Commit. Historical Run `30488889722` passed for prior source `84872ff9042ed9f4364645750bbfa2dc3475e80b`; it does not prove the current TypeScript SDK slice. The workflow publishes no downloadable artifact.

## Current executable integration

The YNX Pay BFT bridge reads authoritative Pay state, emits canonical Pay events, drives the Pay Saga and posts receipt and refund effects to the immutable Billing Ledger. This path is locally tested but is not yet current-source CI verified, centrally accepted or shared-Testnet verified.

## Required merge and acceptance order

1. YNX Integration freezes Envelope v2, Registry v2, error codes, scope names and ownership.
2. Wallet/Auth and App Gateway run signed request, replay, wrong tuple, expiry and revoke vectors.
3. Pay and Chain Core run the shared-Testnet invoice, settlement, receipt, refund and reconciliation vector.
4. Exchange, DEX and Quant owners add registered events, fee boundaries, compensation and reconciliation vectors.
5. Remaining product owners add their registered producer and Saga vectors.
6. Explorer, Monitor and Trust consume correlated evidence.
7. Security/SRE runs production-shaped broker, database, backup, restore, alert, artifact and signer gates.
8. Website consumes only the truthful public metadata after runtime and immutable hosting receipts exist.

## Non-negotiable boundaries

- HTTP success is not Saga completion.
- Analytics cannot modify the operational Event Store or Billing Ledger.
- Network exactly-once delivery is not claimed; controlled effects are idempotent and Inbox-bound.
- Corrections append new entries; history is never silently overwritten.
- Data Fabric does not own Wallet identity, assets, prices, chain finality or product business authority.
- No private key, seed, PEM, PAN, CVV, provider secret or raw private Mail, Social or Cloud content belongs in events, analytics, handoff files or logs.

## Next exact action

Submit the source-bound contract to YNX Integration, then execute `DF-XP-006` and `DF-XP-014` in dependency order. Until those receipts exist, phase remains `INTEGRATE` and every central, staging and public state remains false.
