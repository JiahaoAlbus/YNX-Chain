## Historical-only evidence

`internal/payproduct/proof/live-testnet-payment.json` proves an earlier source version and cannot establish current public deployment or current artifact behavior.

## Missing direct evidence

Fresh Testnet transaction/receipt, sponsored UserOperation, authoritative refund transaction, bridge destination confirmation, central integration, staging/public URLs, hosted immutable artifacts, current Android/iOS install and cold launch, production signatures, store releases, CI run URLs, SBOM/provenance, migration/restore drill, load measurements, deployed telemetry and public `/pay` remain unproven.
