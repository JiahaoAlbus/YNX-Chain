# YNX Developer 0.2.0 Testnet Preview release notes

## 2026-07-27 current-source checkpoint

- Added a fail-closed API Studio with OpenAPI 3.0/3.1 JSON validation, reviewed request previews, explicit approval, origin controls, bounded response inspection, deterministic provider-failure simulations, TypeScript client generation and adapter manifests.
- Added reviewed non-affiliation templates for WalletConnect, Bridge, Card, Search, Storage, Mail, Shipping and Oracle.
- Added a credential-reference-only host broker boundary. Browser JavaScript never resolves credential values.
- Added contract-first handoff, dependency acceptance, ten cross-product vectors and a machine-readable full-goal coverage matrix.
- Added all API Studio labels, approval semantics, dynamic states and bounded error classes across the 12 supported locales; Arabic uses RTL interaction layout while source, JSON and URL fields remain LTR.
- Added tablist/tab/tabpanel semantics, roving focus, ArrowLeft/ArrowRight/Home/End navigation, a focusable polite output region and 390px wrapping rules.
- Repaired placeholder and credential-leak gates so a missing `rg` binary cannot produce false success; the verified fallback now distinguishes findings, clean results and scanner execution failure.
- Verified 22 Developer client tests, 17 Developer Web tests, static claim/workflow checks, standalone Web build, browser module syntax, live compile, same-origin proxy and desktop sandbox boundaries.
- Built the current-source macOS arm64 unsigned Testnet Preview from `9bcb984d475a39cc9fcd7e46fbb00adaee0421ca`; embedded source tree, runtime checkpoint and SBOM provenance; verified extraction, resource self-test, strict ad-hoc/no-Team-ID classification, GUI cold launch, bundled server observation and child cleanup. ZIP SHA-256: `55ec683a9ec59db89331bb4ae45c2666ae4e26921b59ac6ec8284efe268281f9`, 38,450,127 bytes.
- Current-source API Studio is installed locally on macOS arm64 only. The Windows artifact remains historical. Central integration, staging/public deployment, hosted downloads and production signing remain false.

## 2026-07-18 package checkpoint

- Added YNX AI Build plan/review/apply/revert/audit state machine, permission
  matrix, tool timeline, persistence and checkpoint recovery.
- Added optional exact-pinned Grok Build ACP sidecar verification and
  default-deny permission brokerage; no upstream binary is bundled.
- Reworked the Web IDE into a dense VS Code-class workbench structure with
  desktop light/dark, responsive mobile, large text and Arabic RTL evidence.
- Extended the critical workbench vocabulary across 12 locales.
- Added real Windows build/package/portable-install/cold-launch CI workflow.
- Reverified the unsigned macOS ZIP through extraction, ad-hoc signature check,
  resource self-test, real cold launch, bundled child observation and cleanup.
- Preserved Wallet-only deployment: no key custody, no local unsigned bypass,
  and no success without an authoritative receipt.

This is a Testnet Preview candidate. It is not centrally integrated, staged,
publicly deployed, download-hosted, production-signed or store-released.
